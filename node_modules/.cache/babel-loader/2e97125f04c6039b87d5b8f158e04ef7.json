If Inbound has not been able to resolve the dispute with you informally, we each agree to resolve any claim, dispute, or controversy arising out of or in connection with these Terms through binding arbitration or in small claims court (when applicable for qualifying claims). Any arbitration will be administered by the American Arbitration Association under the Consumer Arbitration Rules in effect at the time. Each party will be responsible for paying any filing, administrative, and arbitrator fees in accordance with AAA Rules. All claims must be brought in the parties individual capacity, and not as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class or presentative proceeding. You agree by entering into this, you and Inbound are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate in a class action.        </Typography>\n      </Stack>\n\n      <Stack spacing={{ xs: 1, sm: 1, md: 1 }} sx={{ marginBottom: 3 }}>\n        <Typography variant=\"h6\">\n          9.
